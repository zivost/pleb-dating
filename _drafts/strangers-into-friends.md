*“Don’t talk to strangers.”*

Haven’t we heard this sentence enough? This is the first thing we are taught by our parents. To avoid every ‘stranger’ is the basic precaution to survive in this capricious, complex world. But what we aren’t taught, told or don’t realise is that everyone is a stranger. You meet someone at an art class and a year later you are best friends, but you tend to forget that tiny moment when you were strangers and how much efforts you put in to build this relationship. Or, when you randomly asked someone, where are you from, on a train ride and next thing you know you both are having a fascinating conversation on Game of Thrones. What is common in these entirely different scenarios though? The efforts it took for you to step out of your comfort zone and approach someone. Almost everyone contemplates multiple times before approaching someone, anyone. &nbsp;You see someone everyday in your college or office, but you have never even waved or greeted them. Why though? Not talking to strangers when you are a kid is understandable but why continue this activity when you are a grownup. When you can choose a career for life or life partner for that matter then can’t you just say Hello? There may be many reasons behind this but what is the most common one is to assume the worst out of someone. This is basic human nature. But let’s try and change that. Let’s try and make efforts to have a nice conversation with someone and then decide whether we wish to maintain contact or not. Let’s take the first step for the matter. Lets approach someone today. Now don’t let this idea fill you with dread. You could be talking to your next best friend. Still not convinced? Ok. Let’s try and make this easier for you. We will give you some tips and tricks that would make this whole terrible process easier for you. Now, all of these may not work for every individual, but some would and that is our endgame. We wish to make you comfortable enough in your skin that you can approach someone, anyone without a second thought.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**1\. Smile**

We often don’t realise that this simple curve can do wonders. No one likes to talk to someone with a face full of frowns. Smiling at someone puts a comfortable vibe around you and boosts social connectedness.&nbsp;

**2\. Say the magic word, Hello\!**

Sometimes it’s as simple as greeting someone. Hello, have been an ice breaker many times. What we don’t understand is that the other person may be shy as well. So, by a simple hello you will make them comfortable as well.

**3\. Opening your conversation with a compliment**

This is one of the easiest and most fruitful ice breaking activity. If you are meeting someone for the first time, just compliment them on anything they are wearing. A simple sentence as ‘*I like your bag’&nbsp;*goes a long way and puts you both at ease.&nbsp;

**4\. Make them laugh**

Laughter here is the best cure. People love talking to those who are quirky. So, stop being conscious and just enjoy\!

**5\. Make it about them**

Everyone likes to talk about themselves. Ask the right questions and soon you will see them warming up with you and having a nice conversation.

**6\. Practice**

Practice makes everything perfect\! Don’t worry if you come out aggressive or weird in your first 10 attempts. Trust us that eleventh one would be definately better. So, don’t give up and soon enough you will be a pro at this\!

**7\. Imagine that person to be already your friend**

Just imagine you already know the other person. This way you will treat them with ease and that’s the best way to start a new friendship.

So, go out today and take a chance. As great things come to those who are willing to put themselves out there and risk it all. And what’s the worst that could happen? You won’t make a friend? It’s not like you are in this for that anyway\!
