You agree to promptly notify Pleb if your Payment Method is cancelled (for example, due to loss or theft) or if you become aware of a potential breach of security related to your Payment Method. If you fail to provide any of the foregoing information, you acknowledge that your current Payment Method may continue to be charged for Paid Services and you remain responsible for all such charges.</span></p><p><span>f. </span><strong><span>Change in Amount Authorized.</span></strong><span> If the total amount to be charged varies from the amount you authorized when purchasing any Paid Services (other than due to the imposition or change in the amount of taxes, including without limitation sales and use taxes, duties or other governmental taxes or fees), Pleb will provide notice of the amount to be charged and the date of the charge at least 10 days before the scheduled date of the transaction.
